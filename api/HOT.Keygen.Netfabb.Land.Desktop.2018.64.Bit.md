During their journey, Aras and Nalla encounter various people and situations that challenge their beliefs and values. Aras is a capitalist who believes in success and wealth, while Nalla is a socialist who believes in love and compassion. Aras is cynical and selfish, while Nalla is optimistic and selfless. Aras is engaged to Bala (Kiran Rathod), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist Padaiyacchi (Nassar), while Nalla is secretly in love with her, having met her during his union activities.
  
As they travel by bus, train, and car, they share their stories and opinions with each other. Nalla tells Aras how he fell in love with Bala and how he was disfigured in an accident caused by Padaiyacchi's henchmen. He also tells him how he won a court case against Padaiyacchi's company and got a compensation cheque for his fellow workers. Aras tells Nalla how he became a successful ad filmmaker and how he met Bala through a mutual friend. He also confesses that he does not love Bala and is marrying her only for her money.
  
Along the way, they witness the plight of the poor and the oppressed in the society. They also meet various characters who help them or hinder them in their journey. They encounter a kind-hearted prostitute (Seema), a helpful railway employee (Santhana Bharathi), a greedy hotel owner (Yugi Sethu), a corrupt police officer (Uma Riyaz Khan), and a group of hijackers who try to rob them. Through these experiences, they learn from each other and develop a bond of friendship and respect.
  
Finally, they reach Chennai and part ways. Aras goes to his wedding hall, where he is shocked to see that his bride is Bala, Nalla's lover. He realizes that Nalla knew this all along and sacrificed his love for him. He also learns that Nalla donated his compensation cheque to an orphanage run by Padaiyacchi's henchman (Santhana Bharathi), who was moved by Nalla's kindness. Aras decides to call off the wedding and confronts Padaiyacchi, who admits that he lied to Nalla about Bala's marriage and tried to separate them.
  
Aras rushes to find Nalla, who is about to leave the city by train. He apologizes to him and tells him the truth about Bala. He also tells him that he considers him as his brother and wants him to be happy. Nalla is overwhelmed by Aras's gesture and hugs him. He then asks Aras to take care of Bala and leaves the train. Aras tries to stop him, but Nalla smiles and says "Anbe Sivam" (Love is God) before disappearing into the crowd.
  
The film ends with a voice-over by Haasan, who says that love is the only thing that can unite people of different ideologies and backgrounds. He also says that love is not just a feeling, but a way of life that can make the world a better place.
